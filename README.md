University Document Management System

  This project implements a web-based University Document Management System, designed to facilitate and improve the submission, review, and approval process for academic documents such as projects, theses (TCCs), assignments, tests and exams. The system features distinct interfaces for students and professors, with a unique authentication mechanism based on public wallet addresses for document approval.
